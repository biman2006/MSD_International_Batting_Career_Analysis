Using basic to intermediate SQL knowledge, I completed this analysis project

# 📌 MS Dhoni SQL Analysis 🏏 
📖 Project Overview

This project is a SQL-based data analysis of MS Dhoni’s international batting career.
The analysis is done using MySQL for querying and Python (Pandas) for executing SQL queries and displaying results inside a Jupyter Notebook.

The goal of this project is to practice real-world SQL queries and basic data analysis for internship preparation.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

MySQL

Python

Pandas

PyMySQL

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains match-wise batting data of MS Dhoni, including:

Match ID

Runs scored

Innings information

Match date

Other match-related details

The dataset is stored in a MySQL table named ms_dhoni.

## 📊 Analysis Performed

In this notebook, I performed the following analyses using SQL:

Total number of matches played

Total runs scored in international career

Top 5 highest individual scores

Overall batting average

Year-wise total runs

Year-wise number of matches

Batting performance while batting first vs batting second

Number of 50+ scores

Number of low-score innings

Percentage of innings with 30+ runs (consistency measure)

Basic performance comparisons using SQL aggregations

All queries are written in SQL and executed using Python.

## 📈 Output & Results

SQL query results are displayed using Pandas DataFrames

The notebook focuses on query logic and correctness, not advanced visualization

The analysis helps understand MS Dhoni’s career performance trends

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

Practice SQL queries on a real dataset

Understand how SQL works with Python

Build a beginner-friendly data analytics project

Prepare for Data Analytics / SQL Internship interviews

## 📝 Notes

This is a learning project, not a production system

Advanced SQL concepts are intentionally avoided

Focus is on basic to intermediate SQL skills
